# emotes-interface

Ever want to easily insert commonly used emojis that don't exist in Unicode ![:thonk:](https://emotes.ml/thonk)? Or animated emojis? Or stickers on chat platforms
that don't support them?

Well, `emotes` will do that for you (when we finish programming it). It will be an API so you can insert these emojis easily without having to tediously search for them. Just `GET /thonk` instead of searching Google (or Bing or your favourite search engine). Or upload your own emojis. Or `emotes` will fetch your emote for you from one of our supported providers.

As of now, you don't have to mess with http requests, you can use a soon to-be-available web application where you can browse and get your favorite non-Unicode emotes. Seriously, who wants to memorize this crap.
